    <h2>Caroline Comin</h2>
    <p>Hi my name is Caroline! I have lived in Houston Texas for the past 6 years and before I lived in Canada my whole life. Luckily I have been able to experience extreme heat and cold :)</p>
    <p>This semester is only my second at BYUI and so far it has been great. Currently my major is Computer Information Technology (or CIT for short). I really enjoy it and hopefully with my degree I'll be able to pursue a career with programming.</p>
    <P>I really love to read novels and that is what I spend most of my freetime doing along with sleeping and watching Netflix. I also have spent my whole life doing watersports like wakeboaring, knee boarding, and wakesurfing; all of which I really enjoy doing.</P>
